## Let's build a webmap with NodeJS and Express!
Webmap is a dream of many GIS specialists and carthographers in this universe. Why? Because webmap can significantly reduce the gap between the experts and the dummies just via a web browser. Moreover, in terms of flexibility and integration capability, a webmap can leverage many scripting API capabilities of other applications, in conjunction with the deployed webmap platform. For instance, we can integrate a webmap with ArcGIS API for Python or Geomatica's Python API into a comprehensive geospatial analysis tool for everyone!

Wait, what about R? Yes. Absolutely you can. With the right choice of webmap application platform, you can integrate R's powerful spatial analysis capabilities into a beautiful and intriguing webmap that will open your _*GIS-illiterate*_ top-level managers' mind.

So, let's start from the scratch.

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Update [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) which is installed automatically when installing NodeJS, by issuing command:
```
# npm update -g npm
```
3. Install [nodemon](http://nodemon.io/) package via NPM command:
```
# npm install -g nodemon
```
That's all, and now you're ready to build amazing things.
